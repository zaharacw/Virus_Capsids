This approach generalizes Caspar-Klug theory of quasi-equivalence to account also for non-quasi-equivalent subunit arrangements in icosahedral virus capsids that have been observed experimentally but are not covered by the Caspar-Klug approach. In particular, the new approach is used to explain the structure of polyoma virus, Simian Virus 40 and L-A virus capsids, which are considered structural puzzles in view of Caspar-Klug theory.

abstract = {Understanding the structure and life cycle of viruses is a fascinating challenge with a crucial impact on the public health sector. In the early 1960s, Caspar \& Klug (Caspar \& Klug 1962 Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 27, 1-24) established a theory for the prediction of the surface structures of the protein shells, called viral capsids, which encapsulate and hence provide protection for the viral genome. It is of fundamental importance in virology, with a broad spectrum of applications ranging from the image analysis and classification of experimental data to the construction of assembly models. However, experimental results have provided evidence for the fact that it is incomplete and, in particular, cannot account for the structures of Papovaviridae, which are of particular interest because they contain cancer-causing viruses. This gap has recently been closed by the viral tiling theory, which describes the locations of the protein subunits and inter-subunit bonds in viral capsids based on mathematical tools from the area of quasicrystals. The predictions and various recent applications of the new theory are presented, and it is discussed how further research along these lines may lead to new insights in virology and the design of anti-viral therapeutics.},

abstract = {With few exceptions, the shells (capsids) of sphere-like viruses have the symmetry of an icosahedron and are composed of coat proteins (subunits) assembled in special motifs, the T-number structures. Although the synthesis of artificial protein cages is a rapidly developing area of materials science, the design criteria for self-assembled shells that can reproduce the remarkable properties of viral capsids are only beginning to be understood. We present here a minimal model for equilibrium capsid structure, introducing an explicit interaction between protein multimers (capsomers). Using Monte Carlo simulation we show that the model reproduces the main structures of viruses in vivo (T-number icosahedra) and important nonicosahedral structures (with octahedral and cubic symmetry) observed in vitro. Our model can also predict capsid strength and shed light on genome release mechanisms.},

abstract = {Viruses, the molecular nanomachines infecting hosts ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, come in different sizes, shapes, and symmetries. Questions such as what principles govern their structural organization, what factors guide their assembly, how these viruses integrate multifarious functions into one unique structure have enamored researchers for years. In the last five decades, following Caspar and Klug's elegant conceptualization of how viruses are constructed, high-resolution structural studies using X-ray crystallography and more recently cryo-EM techniques have provided a wealth of information on structures of a variety of viruses. These studies have significantly -furthered our understanding of the principles that underlie structural organization in viruses. Such an understanding has practical impact in providing a rational basis for the design and development of antiviral strategies. In this chapter, we review principles underlying capsid formation in a variety of viruses, emphasizing the recent developments along with some historical perspective.},

@article{Crick:1956,
abstract = {Renewing their collaboration during Watson's return to the Cavendish laboratory in the fall of 1955, Watson and Crick in this article laid out a theory for explaining why all plant viruses whose structure had been studied up to that time were very similar in shape, either rod-shaped (cylindrical) or spherical. In developing their theory they once again benefited from their complementary expertise, namely Crick's extensive knowledge of X-ray crystallography and Watson's previous studies with tobacco mosaic virus and ribonucleic acid. They proposed that plant viruses consistently took one of two shapes because the two chemical components of which they were made up, ribonucleic acid surrounded by a large number of identical protein subunits, were assembled according to a general plan that was determined by "symmetry elements," structural requirements imposed by the shape of each protein subunit and by the angles of the bonds they formed with the ribonucleic acid core.},

abstract = {Spherical capsids are shells of protein subunits that protect the genomes of many viral strains. Although nature displays a range of spherical capsid sizes (reflected by the number of subunits in the formation), specific strains display stringent requirements for forming capsids of specific sizes, a requirement that appears crucial to infectivity. Despite its importance in pathogenicity, little is known regarding the determinants of capsid size. Still less is known about exactly which capsids can undergo maturation events such as buckling transitions?postcapsid-assembly events that are crucial to some virus strains. We show that the exclusive determinant of capsid size is hexamer shape, as defined by subunit?subunit dihedral angles. This conclusion arises from considering the dihedral angle patterns within hexamers belonging to natural canonical capsids and geometric capsid models (deltahedra). From simple geometric models and an understanding of endo angle propagation discussed here, we then suggest that buckling transitions may be available only to capsids of certain size (specifically, T < 7 capsids are precluded from such transformations) and that T > 7 capsids require the help of auxiliary mechanisms for proper capsid formation. These predictions, arising from simple geometry and modeling, are backed by a body of empirical evidence, further reinforcing the extent to which the evolution of the atomistically complex virus capsid may be principled around simple geometric design/requirements.},

@article{Mannige:2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: For survival, most natural viruses depend upon the existence of spherical capsids: protective shells of various sizes composed of protein subunits. So far, general evolutionary pressures shaping capsid design have remained elusive, even though an understanding of such properties may help in rationally impeding the virus life cycle and designing efficient nano-assemblies. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This report uncovers an unprecedented and species-independent evolutionary pressure on virus capsids, based on the the notion that the simplest capsid designs (or those capsids with the lowest "hexamer complexity", C(h)) are the fittest, which was shown to be true for all available virus capsids. The theories result in a physically meaningful periodic table of virus capsids that uncovers strong and overarching evolutionary pressures, while also offering geometric explanations to other capsid properties (rigidity, pleomorphy, auxiliary requirements, etc.) that were previously considered to be unrelatable properties of the individual virus. SIGNIFICANCE: Apart from describing a universal rule for virus capsid evolution, our work (especially the periodic table) provides a language with which highly diverse virus capsids, unified only by geometry, may be described and related to each other. Finally, the available virus structure databases and other published data reiterate the predicted geometry-derived rules, reinforcing the role of geometry in the natural selection and design of virus capsids.},

@article{Mannige:2008,
abstract = {Virus capsids are highly specific assemblies that are formed from a large number of often chemically identical capsid subunits. In the present paper we ask to what extent these structures can be viewed as mathematically tilable objects using a single two-dimensional tile. We find that spherical viruses from a large number of families-eight out of the twelve studied-qualitatively possess properties that allow their representation as two-dimensional monohedral tilings of a bound surface, where each tile represents a subunit. This we did by characterizing the extent to which individual spherical capsids display subunit-subunit (1) holes, (2) overlaps, and (3) gross structural variability. All capsids with T numbers greater than 1 from the Protein Data Bank, with homogeneous protein composition, were used in the study. These monohedral tilings, called canonical capsids due to their platonic (mathematical) form, offer a mathematical segue into the structural and dynamical understanding of not one, but a large number of virus capsids. From our data, it appears as though one may only break the long-standing rules of quasiequivalence by the introduction of subunit-subunit structural variability, holes, and gross overlaps into the shell. To explore the utility of canonical capsids in understanding structural aspects of such assemblies, we used graph theory and discrete geometry to enumerate the types of shapes that the tiles (and hence the subunits) must possess. We show that topology restricts the shape of the face to a limited number of five-sided prototiles, one of which is the "bisected trapezoid" that is a platonic representation of the most ubiquitous capsid subunit shape seen in nature (the trapezoidal jelly-roll motif). This motif is found in a majority of seemingly unrelated virus families that share little to no host, size, or amino acid sequence similarity. This suggests that topological constraints may exhibit dominant roles in the natural design of biological assemblies, while having little effect on amino acid sequence similarity.},
